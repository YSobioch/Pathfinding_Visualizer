# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project acts as a visual tool to display pathfinding algorithms. 
It can be hard when learning about different algorithms to understand what is
going on when you don't have a physical moving example of it, and rather,
just the finished product. As such this tool solves this problem for the 
pathfinding algorithms listed. I myself have learned a great deal about pathing
algorithms, which ones are more efficient in different circumstances, and how
to desplay this information in a way that is understandable and pretty to the
user.

# Algorithms Used

* Djikstra
* A*
* Bi-Directional
* Randomized Prim 

# Features 

Aside from desplaying the algorithms, the app allows for the user to create walls,
move the starting and ending points, and reset the board.
